Tasks
=====

1) implement a retry method that accepts a function and a number of attempts; should retry up to that number of attempts if function fails, then throw exception

2) implement a class extending Iterator which wraps another iterator (potentially over a huge amount of data) and also adds a peek() method which shows the next element but doesnâ€™t advance the pointer
